# ioBroker Asterisk VoIP Adapter

## Install & Configuration of Asterisk with the Fritzbox by using SIP 

First you have to install all the packages described [here](../README.md).

First you have to open the Fritzbox configuration and add a new LAN/WLAN telephone device. In my example, the FritzBox has the IP address 192.168.1.1 and the user name is *12345689* und the password is *mypassword* . The telphone number for outgoing and incoming calls is *03047114711*.

If you do not want, that ioBroker answer the phone, please leave "nur auf folgende Rufnummern reagieren" empty.  Important, the Fritzbox username (Benutzername) musst only consist of numbers. Example: 12345689, 00004711 or 47110815 !!

Now you have to edit the follwoing asterisk configuration files. Delete the old staff in this 3 files! 
Do not change the user authority and user rights of the files. 
 
**/etc/asterisk/manager.conf**
```sh
[general]						; Do not change
enabled = yes						; Do not change
port = 5038						; Do not change
bindaddr = 0.0.0.0					; Do not change

[manager]						; Do not change
secret = managerpassword				; Change Manager password for ioBroker asterisk adapter
permit = 192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0  			; Change to your subnet and netmask
read = all						; Do not change
write = all						; Do not change
```

You have to change in */etc/asterisk/manager.conf* the values *secret*, *permit* (your subnet + subnet mask). 

**/etc/asterisk/sip.conf** 
```sh
[general]				; Do not change
port = 5060				; Do not change
bindaddr = 0.0.0.0			; Do not change
context = default			; Do not change
subscribecontext = default		; Do not change


register => 12345689:mypassword@192.168.1.1/1000 ; Username, Password and IP address of Fritzbox WLAN/LAN telephone

[123456789]               		; Change to username of Fritzbox WLAN/LAN telephone
type = friend			    	; Do not change
username = 123456789      		; Change to username of Fritzbox WLAN/LAN telephone
host = 192.168.1.1        		; Change hostname / IP address of Fritzbox
secret = mypassword       		; Change password of Fritzbox WLAN/LAN telephone
fromdomain = 192.168.1.1  		; Change hostname / IP address of Fritzbox
fromuser = 123456789   	  		; Change username of Fritzbox WLAN/LAN telephone
```

You have to change in */etc/asterisk/sip.conf* the *host* (IP Adress of Fritzbox or VoIP Provider), the *secret*, *username*, *fromuser* with the username configured in the Fritzbox or VoIP Provider. 
Change the *callerid* with your phone number configured in the Fritzbox. Important, the Fritzbox username (Benutzername) musst only consist of number. Example: 12345689, 00004711 or 47110815 !!

**/etc/asterisk/extensions.ael**
```sh
context default {
  	1000 => {
        Goto(ael-antwort,s,1);
  	}
}

context ael-ansage {
	_. => {
        Answer();
        Wait(1);
		Read(dtmf,${file}&beep,0,s,${repeat},1);
		if ("${dtmf}"  != "") {
			SayDigits(${dtmf});
		}
		Hangup();
        }
}

context ael-antwort {
	s  => {
		Answer();
		Wait(1);
		Set(repeat=5);
		Read(dtmf,/tmp/asterisk_dtmf&beep,0,s,${repeat},1);
		if ("${dtmf}"  != "") {
			SayDigits(${dtmf});
		}
    		Hangup();
	}
}
```
Copy the content above into the */etc/asterisk/extensions.ael* and do not change anything! If you change something here, your ioBroker dial command will not work.

For starting the asterisk server type */etc/init.d/asterisk start*
Now you have to connect ioBroker with the asterisk server. If the ioBroker and the asterisk server use as IP adress 192.168.1.2 you have to configure this IP and the port, username and password from the */etc/asterisk/manager.conf* and the unsername of your sip.conf (for example 123456789). You have enter a path for temporary audio files. This path must be accessible and authorized for Asterisk and ioBroker.
